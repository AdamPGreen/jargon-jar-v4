# Jargon Jar - Development Progress

## Authentication Implementation (Week 1)

### Completed
- Set up Supabase project and configured environment variables
- Implemented Slack OIDC authentication flow:
  - Created Supabase client utilities (`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`, `server.ts`, `middleware.ts`)
  - Implemented Next.js middleware for session handling
  - Created sign-in page with Slack authentication button
  - Implemented OAuth callback route handler
  - Successfully tested authentication flow in development environment

### Technical Details
- Using `@supabase/ssr` for Next.js 14 server/client components
- Slack OIDC provider configured with required scopes (`openid`, `email`, `profile`)
- Authentication flow:
  1. User clicks "Sign in with Slack" button
  2. Redirected to Slack for authorization
  3. Callback handled at `/auth/callback`
  4. Session established via Supabase
  5. User redirected to homepage

### Next Steps
- Implement database schema for jargon terms and charges
- Set up user profiles and workspace associations
- Add sign-out functionality
- Implement protected routes

## Database Setup (Week 2)

### Completed
- Created initial database schema based on `docs/schema.md`
  - Tables: `workspaces`, `users`, `jargon_terms`, `channels`, `charges`
  - Enabled `uuid-ossp` extension
  - Established foreign key relationships with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  - Added indexes for common query patterns
  - Implemented `updated_at` triggers on all relevant tables
- Created migration files in `supabase/migrations`:
  - `20240331000000_initial_schema.sql`
  - `20240331000001_seed_jargon.sql`
- Seeded `jargon_terms` table with default global terms from `docs/jargon-dictionary.md`
- Configured Row Level Security (RLS) policies for basic workspace-based access control
- Applied migrations manually via Supabase SQL Editor

### Technical Details
- Modified `jargon_terms.created_by` to be nullable to allow seeding global terms without a specific user creator.
- RLS Policies restrict SELECT operations on core tables to users within the same workspace based on `auth.jwt()->>'sub'` matching `users.slack_id` and associated `workspace_id`.

### Next Steps
- Configure Slack App for slash commands and events
- Implement API endpoints (starting with users and jargon terms)
- Refine RLS policies as application logic evolves
- Add sign-out functionality and protected routes to the web app

## Deployment Progress (Week 1)

### Completed
- Set up Vercel project and configured environment variables:
  - Added Supabase environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
  - Added Slack environment variables (SLACK_CLIENT_ID, SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET, SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET)
  - Successfully deployed to Vercel with environment configuration
  - Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration issues
  - Successfully deployed to production at jargon-jar-v4.vercel.app

### Next Task
- Set up basic Slack slash command `/charge`:
  1. Configure slash command in Slack App settings to point to production URL
  2. Test command in development environment
  3. Implement basic command handler endpoint

### Next Session Prompt
"Now that we have our app deployed to production, let's configure the `/charge` slash command in the Slack App settings. We need to point it to our production URL and test the basic functionality. Can you help me with that?"

## Slack Integration Progress (Week 5)

### Completed
- Successfully configured Slack App settings:
  - Set up OAuth scopes for bot token
  - Configured slash command `/charge` endpoint
  - Enabled interactive components
  - Set up proper environment variables
- Implemented slash command handler:
  - Created `/api/slack/commands/route.ts`
  - Added request verification
  - Implemented modal opening functionality
- Created interactions handler:
  - Set up `/api/slack/interactions/route.ts`
  - Added basic modal submission handling
  - Implemented request verification

### Technical Details
- Using Slack's Block Kit for modal UI
- Implemented proper request verification using Slack's signing secret
- Added diagnostic logging for debugging
- Configured proper CORS headers in `next.config.js`

### Next Steps
- Implement charge creation logic in the interactions handler
- Add user selection to the modal
- Create jargon term selection interface
- Implement charge confirmation flow
- Add error handling and user feedback

### Next Session Prompt
"Now that we have the `/charge` command and modal working, let's implement the charge creation logic. We need to:
1. Add user selection to the modal
2. Create a jargon term selection interface
3. Implement the charge creation in the database
4. Add confirmation messages back to the Slack channel

Can you help me with that?"
