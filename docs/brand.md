# Jargon Jar Brand Style Guide

## Brand Overview

Jargon Jar is an anti-corporate, snarky Slack app that functions as a virtual "swear jar" for corporate jargon. The brand embodies an edgy, punk rock aesthetic with an irreverent tone that stands out from typical corporate applications.

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice

- **Authentic**: Genuine and honest, never pretentious
- **Empowering**: Helps people reclaim authentic communication

### Tone Guidelines
- **Be Bold**: Don't shy away from calling out corporate nonsense
- **Use Humor**: Make the experience fun rather than punitive
- **Stay Grounded**: Maintain relatability, avoid industry jargon of our own
- **Keep it Casual**: Use conversational language, avoid formality
- **Show Personality**: Inject character into all communications

### Sample Copy
✓ "Caught using 'synergy' again? That'll cost ya."  
✓ "Your team just wasted 42 minutes in buzzword bingo. Let's fix that."  
✓ "Congrats! You've gone 3 days without saying 'circle back'."  

✗ "Please refrain from utilizing corporate vernacular."  
✗ "Our solution optimizes communication efficiency."
